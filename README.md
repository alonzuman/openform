# Openform

An open source typeform alternative that doesn't break your bank

## Overview

The idea is to try and create a full stack typeform alternative that is open source and can be self hosted. The goal is to make it as easy as possible to create forms and share them with others.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (React) for the frontend & backend, most of the app is using server components & server actions, trying to keep it this way as much as possible.
- ShadcnUI for the UI components
- PostgreSQL for the database
- Prisma for the ORM
- Vercel for hosting
